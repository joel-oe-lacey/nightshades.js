## Features
Users can select an edible plant of their choosing from an autocomplete. Upon selecting a plant, they can then view details on that plant, including whether it's Tom Brady Approved ™️. Sourcing the data on the client side requires the utilization of a very basic Express server for JWT auth.

This app is built as a goofy exploration into some fun development concepts, namely Variable Fonts & JWT authorization.
