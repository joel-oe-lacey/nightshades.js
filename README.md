The data is sourced from the [**Trefle API**](https://trefle.io/)

## Features
Users can select a tdwg region from an autocomplete. Upon selecting a region, they can view all native plants for that region in a paginated display. They can then click on a plant to open a modal displaying images and information pertaining to that plant in a tabbed display. Sourcing the data on the client side requires the utilization of a very basic Express server for JWT auth.
